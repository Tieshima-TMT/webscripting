			<p>My name is Holly Silvia. I’m a graphic designer and adjunct professor with a passion for illustration and design. I graduated May 2016 from Southwestern College with a B.S. in Computer Science with an Emphasis in Digital Art. In November 2019, I graduated from Full Sail University to attain a M.F.A. in Media Design. When I was a teenager, I started out doing design work for my mom’s friends. Those friends would then recommend me to their friends and by the time I was in college I stared to build my own client list. Since then, I’ve been working as a freelance graphic designer and illustrator. I’ve worked for private clients as well as companies like FlightSaftey International and Southwestern College. I’ve been at Butler CC since 2017 where I teach some of the visual art classes along with PHP and Javascript.
